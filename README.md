# Digital Music Stand

This is a prototype for a digital music stand concept developed for the University of Waterloo's Human-Computer Interaction course, CS489.

A demonstration of this project can be [found on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHkkMqeICIo).

This project is intended only as a rough demonstration of some key ideas developed, and should not be viewed as production safe, etc.
